## version 3.0.0
This is a total re-write of the pipeline in a new repository, replacing versions 1 and 2 that are still available at [https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline).
There are numerous changes to the pipeline structure in version 3 relative to versions 1 and 2, although much of the logic of the pipeline is the same.

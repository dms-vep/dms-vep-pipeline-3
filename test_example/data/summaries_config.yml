# Configuration for creating summary plots across assays.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define how to create an integrated set of line plots and heat maps that summarizes
# antibody escape alongside other assays (eg, functional effects of mutations).

summary:
  min_times_seen: 3  # only include mutations with times_seen >= this

  title: Mutation effects across assays
  legend: |
    This is is an interactive chart. Mouseover points on the top line plots that
    summarize the per-site escape averaged across all sera and for individual sera.
    You can use the top zoom-bar or the line plots to zoom in on specific sites to
    show in the heatmaps that give per-mutation effects on serum escape or protein
    function. The options at the bottom let you only show escape for sites with some
    minimal functional effect (more deleterious mutations are grayed out in heatmap),
    choose the site summary metric, or floor the escape at zero.

# Configurations for determining effects of mutations on antibody/sera escape

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for each antibody selection experiment.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `antibody_selections` is keyed by name of each selection experiment, which includes a
# no-antibody control samples and one or more antibody samples. These should typically
# be from the same library and run on same date. Selection experiments are recommended
# to be named as <Library>-<date as YYMMDD>-<description (eg, antibody)>-<replicate>.
# Each selection experiment should in turn provide the following keys:
#  - `neut_standard_name`: name of neutralization standard in `neut_standard_barcodes`
#  - `no_antibody_sample`: name of the no-antibody sample
#  - `antibody_samples`: a dict keyed by sample name with values of:
#    * `concentration`: the concentration of the antibody
#    * `use_in_fit`: whether to use this sample in the `polyclonal` fit
# The `use_in_fit` option exists because you may decide that some samples are outside
# the preferred neutralization range to include in the fit, so if `use_in_fit: false`
# then functional scores are computed and plotted but it is not included in the fit.

# Pipeline Information

Here's an example of what an overview of the analysis pipeline could look like.

## `Snakemake` Workflow

You can include a link to [the repository](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3) and key data files here. You can also [point to the 'Appendix'](/appendix){target="_self"} with details about the pipeline. The 'Appendix' is the same as the original `docs/` created by the `Snakemake` pipeline.

In principle, you could also include an image of the workflow.
